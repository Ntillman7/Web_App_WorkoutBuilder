Workout Builder App

## Workout Builder
This is an app I created using Django following the MVT framework. I used HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Python to create an app that allows the user to track their daily workouts and create workout plans.

The app also makes use of a weather API so that the user can plan outdoor workouts and web scraping from beautiful soup to show example workouts and schedules for the user.
